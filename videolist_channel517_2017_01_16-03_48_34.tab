The South Korean president voted to impeach by the National Assembly on December 9. The Constitutional Court?s ruling on the validity of the impeachment vote began on Friday.

Park is accused of granting her friend undue influence over her presidential decisions, which allegedly allowed Choi to solicit business donations for her own non-profit fund. Choi was arrested over the allegations on November 3.	22	People & Blogs	PT37S	37	2d	hd	false		0	0	0	0	0

Park is embroiled in an influence-peddling scandal that's seriously threatening her position as leader of South Korea. The crisis focuses on Park's longtime friend and confidante Choi Soon-sil who has been charged with meddling in state affairs. She also allegedly abused her relationship with the president for personal gains. Tens of thousands have taken part in protest rallies over the last two weekends calling on the president to step aside. And that pressure looks set to grow even more this weekend.

Members of parliament voted by secret ballot with 234 in favor and 56 opposed, meaning dozens of members of Park's own conservative Saenuri Party backed the motion to remove her. At least 200 members of the 300-seat chamber needed to vote for the motion for it to pass. Seven votes were disqualified, two members abstained and one member did not participate, the parliament speaker said. The Constitutional Court must decide whether to uphold the motion, a process that could take up to 180 days. Park's duties were immediately assumed by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on an interim basis. Park, 64, is accused of colluding with a friend and a former aide, both of whom have been indicted by prosecutors, to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back her policy initiatives. Park, who is serving a single five-year term that was set to end in February 2018, has denied wrongdoing but apologized for carelessness in her ties with her friend, Choi Soon-sil. Park has been under heavy pressure to quit but this week said she would await the court's ruling on the impeachment vote. Mass rallies have been held in the capital, Seoul, every Saturday for the past six weeks to press her to quit. Opinion polls show overwhelming public support for her impeachment. Parliament was closed to the public on Friday on the orders of the speaker. Hours before the vote, anti-Park activists scuffled with police as they tried to drive two tractors up to parliament's main gate, where more than a 1,000 protesters were gathered. Police subsequently shut down traffic on a 10-lane highway in front of the parliament's grounds and blockaded a bridge leading to the area. POLITICAL, ECONOMIC WORRIES The daughter of a military ruler who led the country for 18 years before being assassinated by his disgruntled spy chief in 1979, Park would lose presidential immunity if she left office early, and could be prosecuted for abuse of power and bribery, among other charges. A poll released on Friday showed her approval rating at 5 percent, a slight improvement from a record low 4 percent. The survey by Gallup Korea - which is not affiliated with U.S.-based Gallup, Inc. - showed 81 percent of respondents supported impeachment. If the motion passes, the Constitutional Court will determine whether parliament followed due process and whether there are sufficient grounds for impeachment, a process that will involve arguments from the two sides in public hearings. Prime Minister Hwang, who post is largely ceremonial, will assume interim presidential powers while the court deliberates. Hwang takes the helm at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. South Korea's economic outlook is also worsening, in part because of the internal political uncertainty, as well as worry about the impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies on trade and foreign affairs. The 9-member Constitutional Court is considered conservative in its makeup but some of its former judges have said the case against Park is strong and was likely to be approved. In 2004, parliament impeached then-president Roh Moo-hyun, suspending his powers for 63 days while the court reviewed the decision, which it overturned. The most-searched items on leading web portal Naver on Friday were related to what happened around Roh's impeachment. The prime minister at the time, Goh Kun, said in a 2013 memoir that he had decided to stay "low key" while he held the reins of power.

Up to half a million protesters are expected by organizers to participate in the Seoul rally, and the same number in other cities, on Saturday for the fourth straight week in a row. The mass anti-Park demonstrations, accompanied by fierce opposition at the parliament, have posed a real challenge to the president, who has nevertheless been defiant of calls on her to step down.

Park is the first woman to be elected as President in South Korea, and is serving the 18th presidential term. Park is the first female president of a Northeast Asian nation,[2] the third female to act as head of state in East Asia after Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa and Soong Ching-ling. Prior to her presidency, Park was the Chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) from 2004 to 2006 and from 2011 to 2012 (the GNP changed its name to the "Saenuri Party" in February 2012). Park was also a member of the Korean National Assembly, and served four complete consecutive parliamentary terms as a constituency representative between 1998 and 2012. Park started her fifth term as a proportional representative in June 2012. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was the President of South Korea from 1963 to 1979. In 2013 and 2014, Park was ranked 11th on the Forbes list of the world's 100 most powerful women and the most powerful woman in East Asia.[3] In 2014, Park was ranked 46th on the Forbes list of the world's most powerful people, the third-highest South Korean on the list after Lee Kun-hee and Lee Jae-yong. Tens of thousands of men, women and children joined one of the largest anti-government protests seen in Seoul for decades on Saturday, demanding President Park Geun-Hye’s resignation over a snowballing corruption scandal. Police had planned for 170,000 people, but organisers said they expected a final turnout of up to one million for what was the third in a series of weekly mass protests that have left Park fighting for her political survival.	22	People & Blogs	PT21M52S	1312	2d	hd	false		2	0	0	0	0

The court confirmed that it will hear several allegations against Park. She’s accused of colluding with her confidante Choi Soon-Sil to extort money and favors from major companies. Park is also accused of ordering aides to leak state documents to Choi. Park was suspended from her duties nearly two weeks ago, after lawmakers impeached her. The impeachment bill also accuses Park of being responsible for media restrictions and government inaction during a deadly ferry sinking back in 2014. South Korea’s constitutional court says it will also review these accusations. The court has up to six months to decide whether to oust Park.

(Article links are below - trust me, it's interesting) I just came back from a huge rally (candlelight vigil) this weekend as the president's political scandal is the hottest issue everywhere in Korea right now. This is the new chapter of Korea's democracy as the protest consisted of more than 100,000 people but was conducted as a peaceful demonstration. It was great to see people claiming their rights as citizens and speaking up to the corruption of the government and the president. The largest protest will be on November 12th but there might be other agendas added by various labor unions so you might want to do your research to know which agenda you're supporting. You will hear that the current President Park should be hospitalised as she doesn't seem mentally stable and is unable to empathize with the people as her parents (previous dictators of Korea during 1961-1979) were assassinated.

So obviously this is quite a hot issue right now and I figured you guys may be interested in what some of the foreign community think about the matter. If you enjoyed this video and would like me to do more interview videos on the street, then please let me know! And also make sure to let me know your opinion on the subject in the comments section! 자막 // Subtitles: 안녕하세요 여러분 Hey guys 네 최근에 좀 큰 사건이 하나가 터졌는데요, So recently there’s been obviously some controversy 남한 대통령 박근혜와 관련된 일입니다 With the president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye 그리고 저번 주말에 적어도 백만 명의 사람들이 시위를 하러 모였다는 뉴스도 있었고요 There were reportedly over a million people at the protest this weekend in Seoul 그리고 대부분의 한국 국민들이 박근혜가 퇴진을 해야 한다는 의견을 보였습니다 And the general consensus is that the Korean people want her to step down as president 그래서 제가 이번 일에 대해서 외국인들의 의견을 모아보자 해서 나오게 됐어요 I’ve come out here basically to get some foreign people’s opinions about the matter 제가 질문할 것은; 박근혜 대통령이 내려와야 한다 남아있어야 한다에 대한 것이거든요 So I was wondering if you were for or against Park Geun-hye leaving office 저는 물러나야 한다고 생각해요, 브라질에서 있었던 일을 보셨잖아요 I’m for, like you’ve seen what happened in Brazil 네, 정확하네요 Yeah, exactly yeah 브라질도 역사상 처음으로 여성 대통령이 나왔는데 임기 중 사임한 대통령이 됐거든요 We had our first female president and the first one to resign as well 전 내려와야 한다고 생각해요 I’m for her leaving 왜냐면 전 사람들이 정치에 있어서 더 많은 힘을 가지고 있어야 한다고 생각하거든요 Because I think the people should have more power in regards to politics 관련된 모든 일들이 좀 수상하다고나 할까요 And it all does sound a bit shady and stuff 저는 완벽하게 중립입니다, 제가 여기 살지 않기 때문에 I am definitely neutral because I do not live here 그러니까 말씀드릴 것이 없네요 So I have no say so 솔직히 말씀드리자면, 제 생각에 박 대통령이 아주 이상한 위치에 있다고 생각해요 Honestly, I think that she is in a really awkward position 임기 종료까지 1년 밖에 남지 않았고 Because she only has one year left in her term 당연히 미국 같이 재선도 안 될 테고 And she’s obviously not gonna run for reelection 지금 당장 야당은 박 대통령이 대통령직에서 내려온 이후에 그 자리에 들어갈 Right now the opposition parties do not have anyone that they can nominate 인물을 선정해 놓지도 않았죠 That can come in after her 그러니까 정치적으로 봤을 땐 압력이 아주 약해요 So politically there is very little pressure 계속 쌓이기는 하고 있지만 말이죠 It is mounting still 네 Yeah 왜냐하면, 아까 말씀하신 것과 같이, 매주 지지율도 떨어지고 있는데 Because it’s like you said, the approval ratings have been dropping every single week 여기서 해야 할 것은 그 권력 이양이라고 생각합니다 And the trick is going to be that transition 상황에 따라서 다른데요, 탄핵 같은 경우에는 한국에 그렇게 좋을 거라고 생각하지 않아요 It depends, like if its impeachment, I don’t think it’s very smart for the country 그렇게 한다면 내년 다음 선거까지 정치 활동들이 완전히 정지될 테니까요 Because then you’ll just have dead political activity until the next elections next year 하지만 박 대통령이 내려오고 다른 사람이 임시 대통령이 된다면 그건 괜찮을 거라고 생각해요 But if she would step down and somebody acts as an interim president maybe that’s better 왜냐하면 제가 듣기로는 박 대통령이 한국에는 그렇게 좋지 않거든요 Because right now, she’s not that good for this country from what I’ve heard so	27	Education	PT4M31S	271	2d	hd	false		16	0	0	0	0

South Korea's Satanic President Park Geun-hye Impeached - Millions Protest In The Streets	Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO South Korean President Forced To Step Down When People Find Out She is Involved In Satanic Rituals, According to sources, the female President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, was having a relationship with another female named Choi Soon-sil. Choi Soon-sil is apparently from a billionaire satanic cultist family and has ties to the Clintons, as most other billionaire cultists do. As their relationship grew, Choi Soon-sil was given top clearance state secrets and million-dollar deals were made with her, at the expense of the South Korean people. Choi would receive the president’s plan for governance, and ran her own “shadow cabinet” that would give comment on the presidential policy plans. The net result was astonishing. It appears that Choi was involved in virtually every major policy initiative from the Park Geun-hye administration. Choi even received national security briefings and gave comments on Park’s Dresden speech- the most significant pronouncement of South Korea’s policy on North Korea. http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/12/south-korean-president-forced-to-step-down-when-people-find-out-she-is-involved-in-satanic-cult/ -~-~~-~~~-~~-~- Please watch: "BREAKING - PIZZAGATE Investigation May Indicate RARE Eye Anomaly In Children Linked To Soros" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxYKvkKVvME -~-~~-~~~-~~-~-	22	People & Blogs	PT6M6S	366	2d	hd	false		0	0	0	0	0

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO http://www.holographic-disclosure.com/\ http://nationalvanguard.org/2012/05/the-silent-coup-putin-vs-the-oligarchs/ The illuminated Cabal are desperate to start a world war, not only to white wash their scams worldwide so that Wall Street can keep the $40 trillion they stole from us and steal another $20 trillion or more on the Day the Dollar Dies but it’s also to try and stop the public from ever finding out about our true history that has suffered 2,000 years of corruption. Putin's opposition to the Cabal’s “unipolar world" Code name for NWO is now not only obvious: but more than likely credible. Russia is under constant attack by the globalists who wish to exploit internal divisions to destabilize Russia and install a Zionist lap dog leader like they have in so many places as was the case with Ukraine. On the 17 of July 2014 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was either shot down or blown up Close to the border of Ukraine and Russia. There are now strong speculations that an assassination attempt on Putin’s life was connected to the bringing down of flight 17: Vladimir Putin was going to travel to South America for the last game of the World Cup and for the Bric’s Conference in Brazil which is a direct attack on the Rothschild-headed Global Banking Cartel's power over the global economy and financial system. According to Russia's Interfax News Agency, the Presidential State Aircraft IL-96 and a similar sized Boeing 777 (Flight MH17) were traveling along the same route over Poland on the way back from South America. Putin’s plane and the Malaysian Boeing intersected at the same point and the same echelon. That was close to Warsaw on 330-m echelon at the height of 10,100 meters. “The contours of the aircrafts are similar, linear dimensions are also very similar, as for the colouring, at a quite remote distance they are almost identical”, But taking the Russian State Aircraft down presented a number of problems. If it were downed over the open ocean, fingers would point at America as the superpower capable of global military action. Host nations did provide considerable security to Putin and his aircraft while he was in their nations and airspace. What better place to attack the IL-96 than over Russian airspace near the Ukraine, shortly after it had left Polish airspace. As I have mentioned earlier in part one, The Russians have recently developed a new stealth technology or should I say re- development of stealth technology thousands of years old. Yes you heard correctly thousands of years old. Russian engineers devised a way to 'stealth' existing non-stealthy aircraft using a plasma system. This system has no doubt been copied by various western powers. However, no such system is perfect and highly advanced electronic systems can usually detect a stealth aircraft. They are now working on the black hole project in which the aircraft will disappear completely. ECM stands for “electronic counter measures”. The Presidential Russian ECM aircraft can spoof things by turning off or changing its ID squawking and a nearby large aircraft, the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 Flight MH17 was spoofed to cover its normal ID code and replace it with the IL-96 code, that probably led to the deaths of 295 people on Malaysian Airlines Flight. The Russians at this stage have no advantage to 'outing' the true story. Another conspiracy going around is that the plane was filled up with dead bodies due to the composing of body parts. Let me tell you if a plane explodes at 33,000 feet and people are plunging down at that altitude they would turn blue and look bloated from the freezing temperatures and the impact.

Według sondażu z grudnia 2014 roku z jego decyzjami wciąż zgadza się 86 procent obywateli. Barbara Włodarczyk szuka źródeł tego fenomenu.

He also known as most badass politician. TheMaster (mmamaster) Subscribe now! Click here: http://goo.gl/x1ngVA Putin biography and facts: Vladimir Putin (Владимир Путин) was elected president of the Russian Federation in 2012, beginning his third full term as president of Russia since taking over as the hand-picked successor of Boris Yeltsin in 1999. After earning a law degree in 1975, Vladimir Putin joined the KGB, the security force of the former Soviet Union. He spent years working primarily in East Germany, then left the service in 1991 and became active in the politics of St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad). He was brought to Moscow by Yeltsin in 1996 and served as an administrator in the Kremlin and an official for the security organizations which replaced the KGB. In 1999, Putin became Yeltsin's fifth prime minister in 17 months, then became acting president when Yeltsin abruptly left office. He was officially elected to the office in 2000 and then re-elected in a landslide vote in March of 2004. As president he gained a reputation as a clever and ruthless political operator with a hunger for Russian power and not too much concern for the niceties of democracy or diplomacy. He stepped down in 2008 (as required by term limits) and was replaced by his own hand-picked successor, Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev then installed Putin as prime minister, a move which left Putin, as The New York Times put it, as "the country's dominant politician, with a firm grip on power." This seemed to be proved out in March of 2012, when Vladimir Putin was again elected president for a fresh six-year term. #1. In his biography, Vladimir Putin revealed that in his childhood, he spent his free time hunting rats. #2. He has two daughters but keeps their private lives top secret. #3. He has several pet dogs and used one to scare German chancellor Angela Merkel. #4. In order to honour the Russian President’s 62nd birthday, a one-night-only art display of “The 12 Labours of Putin” was created by an artist who adores his nation’s leader. #5. Among other bizarre 62nd-birthday tributes, a 2,000-foot-long Russian flag was created by Grozny natives who stood on the streets of the town dressed in different colours, while a huge banner with a cartoon of US President Barack Obama wearing a Putin T-shirt which was the hung from a bridge for everyone to see. #6. Putin helped to put out wildfires in the Russian countryside by co-piloting an aircraft. #7. His grandfather cooked meals for Vladimir Lenin And Joseph Stalin. #8. For 16 years Putin worked as an officer in the KGB (the Committee for State Security), spying for the secret police agency in East Germany between 1975 and 1991. #9. T-shirts bearing images of the Russian leader, as well Putin canned food, Putinka Vodka and Gorbusha Putina caviar, are sold throughout the nation. #10. Although no-one knows for sure, it has been alleged that Putin has a huge personal wealth estimated to a whopping worth of £46 billion. #11. Putin is a huge fan of the Beatles. #12. He grew up in a shared apartment in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, the Russian city ravaged by World War Two.

It is a salafi-jihadist cult, propped up by the Saudi state and seasoned with US dollars. It achieves certain foreign policy objectives, and is largely out in the open in the modern day. Russia has previously fought off its predecessor- Al Qaeda. Both of the Chechen wars of the 1990s were funded and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US. NGOs such as Medicins Sans Frontiers were documented to have been smuggling supplies to the Chechen rebels, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides of the conflict. On New Year’s Eve 1999, Vladimir Putin would inherit the Russian presidency. With it, he inherited a very damaged and weary country. Given that the previous President, Boris Yeltsin, was in no physical state to rule – it is evident that Putin’s work started long before his inauguration. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Russia was plagued by horrific acts of terrorism (Beslan, Nord-ost, etc), which in Western media were packaged as acts of “Chechen freedom fighters." Should the rebels prevail, Putin envisaged the extensive loss of Russia’s territories and the possibility of an ‘Islamic State’. Not only was the Russian government successful in their military campaign, despite a crumbling economy at the time, but they were able to mend ties with Chechen leaders, who today staunchly oppose radical Islam. With this understanding in mind, Putin's decision to engage in the 2015 Syrian campaign was completely logical. He knows where it leads and doing nothing is not an option. Russia has cut off the group’s revenue (illegal oil extraction, freely taking place under the ‘Western alliance’), and disrupted the partitioning of Syria. It curbed the creation of an extremist 'Islamic State', with the self-proclaimed 'ISIS capital' in Raqqa. The 'jihadist breeding programme' in Syria was almost identical to the one in Chechnya. Having paid a very high price in the 1990s, Russia will never again fight jihadists on its own soil. However, will Europe? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT10M29S	629	2d	hd	false		42	0	0	0	0

In Russia, it is the law to provide 20 weeks (or more, in case of complications) of paid leave, at 100% of the mother’s salary. It is time for US citizens to start questioning the wellbeing of their own country, before labeling other world leaders “tyrants” and “dictators.” In this clip, a woman enquires with President Putin in regard to the possibility of a “mother’s salary”, for the difficult task of raising multiple children. The Mothers’ Assistance Programme has been active in Russia since 2007 and can be accessed by any family that has two or more children to raise. Either mother or father can apply, and in the case of the child being adopted, or from another marriage – the applicant parent does not need to be a Russian citizen. The Programme can be utilized toward almost any cost to do with raising children; from funding toward mortgages, rental costs, the child’s education to any level (up to the age of 23), and medical costs. Meanwhile. it does not take a far-Right extremist to see that there is a white-race genocide taking place in Europe ; not a violent one, but simply a development that stems from cultural norms. Not only are European immigration policies unsustainable for native races to remain the majority in the future, but the added possibility of polygamy becoming legal for Muslim migrants in Europe actually ensures that future. After the collapse of the USSR, Russia experienced one of the worst demographic crises in the developed world – death rates outstripped birth rates in their millions, and the only balancing factor was labour migration from former Soviet republics. Some predictions were so dire, that the most pessimistic of analysts thought there would not be a Russian race in the next century. Today, Russia allows for women to stay at home and raise multiple children, if that is their vocation. Almost 5 million multi-child families are utilising the Programme, with over 90% of payouts going toward housing, in which to raise children.

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO The Russian president voiced his disgust at a decayed and immoral culture which has overtaken the West A man who raped a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Austria has had his conviction overturned after judges found he may have believed the child consented. Police said the 20-year-old Iraqi refugee, who has not been named, assaulted his victim in a toilet cubicle at the Theresienbad swimming pool in Vienna on 2 December last year. The child reported the rape to a lifeguard and his attacker was arrested at the scene, reportedly telling officers in initial interviews that he was experiencing a “sexual emergency” after not having sex in four months. Vienna's historic pools are not safe anymore The "sexual emergency" experienced by the rapefugee was apparently similar to the one experienced by 2,000 rapefugees in the German city of Cologne on New Year's Eve 2016, when they publicly raped 1,200 German women as emasculated German men and police stood by and watched. Apparently some of the women were merely groped. The German government was appalled. That's why it decided to produce an illustrated manual teaching the refugees how to rape German women properly next time around. Not to be outdone, Austria has now decided to join its German brethren in refusing to defend even children from homosexual rape - as long as the children "consent": [O]n Thursday, Austria’s Supreme Court overturned the rape conviction and ordered a re-trial on the charge. [...]Supreme Court judges ruled that the first court should have established whether the attacker thought his victim agreed to a sexual act and intended to act against the boy’s will. We are in fact now witnessing the violent death of western civilization. It is bad enough that Europe is being inundated by hordes of invaders of a culture, religion, and ethnicity totally incompatible with the West, but most reprehensible of all is the total lack of any will to resist on the part of Europeans themselves, and especially their governments (with notable exceptions, such as the Hungarians). Far from it - they even take active steps to encourage and accommodate the invaders. But we all know the real threat to Europe is not from millions of barbaric non-European rapefugees, it's from Russia and Vladimir Putin. Ask Poland. Or Lithuania. Russia is hell, and Putin is the devil. Putin also noted that Russia as a state, has encompassed multiple ethnicities and cultures for over 1000 years, and that unlike Europe, it has a proven track record of managing inter-ethnic relations. Despite the presence of a vocal liberal minority, the great majority of Russians agree with their leader that if these are the kind of "European values" the West has on offer, it is better to remain the "backward" conservative society that continually draws the unfettered ire of liberal paragons in Europe and America. The only question is whether eastern European nations such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Poland - which are in their inherent culture and moral outlook far more similar to Russia than to the modern Germans, Americans, and French - will come to their senses in time to save themselves from the cultural rot devouring the core of the societies with which they are presently so enamored.

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Are The Elite Rushing For WORLD WAR?!?! Has martial law been secretly declared in Russia?! As of Tuesday, October 11th, 2016, Russian-based website Znak released a cryptic report — in which Russian officials, deputies, regional administrations, and public staff were advised to return home to Russia. Amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin advised that the order be made for the entire nation. With all the war games and military drills, the question still remains: What Does Mr. Putin Know That We DON’T? Because last week, as of October 4-7th, 2016, Russia also conducted a 4-day civil defense drill… where over 40 MILLION Russians participated in emergency response plans, natural disaster preparation, and even national crisis management. And we know that it’s not just Russia, either — because America has also been similarly preparing under the guises of the United Nations: along with Germany, Czech Republic, and also Ukraine. Which is no surprise, considering how Russia has just recently deployed missiles in Kaliningrad, just between Poland and Lithuania. While mainstream media continues to dub this as “World War 3” in the making, the U.S. Army has even warned that a future war with Russia or China would be “extremely lethal and fast.” Not to mention Russia’s recent allegations — where the U.S. blamed them for infiltrating and hacking into the emails and the 2016 elections… when we know better than this.

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Putin has been quoted as saying that the collapse of the USSR was the geopolitical tragedy of the century. In this clip, he explains that he meant it not in the sense of an ‘Empire lost’, but that it was truly a humanitarian tragedy for the people of the Soviet Union. The collapse of the USSR created one of the largest diasporas that exist in the world today – 1 out of every 4 ethnic Russians do not live in Russia itself. Some analysts have even suggested that the numbers of those, who died during the 1990s and early 2000s due to political and social upheaval, as well as military conflict, rivals those lost in Stalin’s 1930s. The amount of those who fled Russia within those decades is estimated to be around 30 million worldwide. Of course, as people settle in new places, they marry into their hosting nations and have children who no longer speak the language. It may just be that it will never be possible to bring back the majority of those who fled, but if anything will – it is Russia’s continued rise and stability, in an economic sense. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT4M9S	249	2d	hd	false		4	0	0	0	0

"For us it became clear and we received information that there were plans not only for his capture, but, preferably for those who carried out the coup, but also for his physical elimination. As one famous historical figure said: no person, no problem," Interfax reported Putin as saying in the film. Mass protests over Yanukovich's decision to back away from a trade agreement with the European Union in favour of closer ties with Moscow ousted him from power in February last year, and he fled to sanctuary in Russia. Interfax quoted Putin as saying that saving the life of Yanukovich and his family was a "good deed". The film documents the events that led up to Russia's annexation of Crimea and provided details of Yanukovich's last hours in Ukraine before fleeing to Rostov on Don, in southern Russia. Putin, speaking in an interview for the documentary "Crimea: Path to the Homeland", said Yanukovich had called on February 21 last year to lay out plans to leave the capital where violent street protests had been raging for weeks. "I told him my point of view that in such a situation it's best not to leave the capital," said Putin. From Kiev, Yanukovich left to Kharkiv and then travelled on to Donetsk, where he called Putin asking for help. Putin suggested meeting him personally in Rostov on Don in southern Russia, but Yanukovich's plane was not given permission to leave. He then travelled to Crimea from where he was spirited to Russia.	25	News & Politics	PT14M13S	853	2d	hd	false		0	0	0	0	0

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Russia’s main religion is Christian Orthodoxy – but it is also home to almost 20 million Muslim citizens. In 2015, concerned about the harrowing situation in the Middle East, Putin opened Europe’s largest Mosque in Moscow. Similarly, the largest Islamic education center in Europe is also due to open in 2017. Some Russians view this as a threat to Christiandom – however, the opposite is true. Sometimes, Western or even Christian perceptions of Islam are truly ignorant. The concept of fanaticism on religious grounds was of course facilitated by the West itself. Initially, this was done by the British Empire, to be used against the Ottomans. Since then, Salafist/Wahhabists have continually been pawns in foreign policy objectives. Need to take down a government? Bring in the Toyota-driving fanatics! In 2015, the flow of migrants into Europe from the ‘Syrian Refugee Crisis’ was orchestrated by the likes of George Soros and his NGOs. Half of them weren’t even of Syrian origin, and not one rich Gulf country took in any refugees at all – and neither did Israel. The entire guilt trip of the ordeal was put onto the shoulders of the European taxpayer. Soros is a self-professed maniac with “messianic tendencies.” In his book, he wrote that he has always felt a need to re-sew the world, create artificial borders, while destroying the nation-state. This is because without a nation-state, there can be no consensus on national interests. No national interests, means it is easier for the invisible hand to govern how it see fits. Most notably, one goal is to turn us into economic slaves, without a nationality, without an understanding of who we are. The few European governments who are resisting this are immediately branded ‘nationalists’, ‘fascists’ and ‘dictators.’ Russia has always been a multicultural, multi-religious state. Sometimes ethnic tensions flare up – especially if the cauldron is stirred by outside forces. At other times, they unite. But artificial re-population of whole regions, with nationalities that are not native to the area – that is an entirely different concept. Soros is clinically a sociopath and should be admitted to some kind of ward. Furthermore, there are no laws in Europe that prohibit perversions of Islam from being taught – (Youtube Fahad Qureshi, who runs the extremist IslamNet.com out of Norway.) So, while Wahhabi cults are popping up all over Europe – Putin builds cultural bridges, anticipating the potential clashes of the future. If he is not a visionary in your view, who is? (PS – Given Turkey’s blatant relationship with ISIS militants, Erdogan looked a little sheepish there in the audience.) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT5M36S	336	2d	hd	false		12	0	0	0	0

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Signed into law by President Obama, the "Magnitsky Accountability Act” was passed in 2012. The main intention of this legislation was to "punish" Russian officials who were “thought” to be responsible for the death of financial lawyer Magnitsky, who had died in prison in Russia. The officials on this ”Magnitsky List”, none of whom accept these charges, are prohibited from entrance to the United States and the use of its banking system. In response, Russia compiled a list of 18 Americans to be banned from entering the Russian Federation. These individuals are implicated in human rights violations, including those involved in legalising torture and indefinite detention of prisoners (such as Dick Cheney’s Chief of Staff, David Addington.) The moral of this story is not so much what happened to Magnitsky, but the outrageous hypocrisy that is being practiced by the US in almost every sphere, including human rights. If there was no Guantanamo, no death penalty, no persecution of whistle blowers, no world's highest incarceration rate, no police brutality, no prisoner slave labour, etc - maybe US leadership could be justified in their seeming moral authority. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT3M21S	201	2d	hd	false		0	0	0	0	0

An example to be emulated. Sometimes he seems nearly untouchable. Yet, strong leaders leave behind big shoes to fill. Currently, no one in Russia is qualified to replace Putin. In fact, the President himself may no longer be up to the challenge. Russian politics is often compared to a dogfight under a carpet. An outsider only hears the growling and when only one dog comes from beneath it’s obvious who won. At the moment, that’s exactly what’s happening in Russia. There is no mention of this in the mainstream media, but for the past few years, the elites have been in a rigorous power play. With the low energy prices and Western sanctions, resources are shrinking. The oligarchs and regional officials are fighting for scraps of power. Putin may be a brilliant politician but the Russia he has created is the new Sick Man of Europe.

This was said in response to the US missile defense system that was being developed at the time (previously prohibited in international law.) Russia’s counter-measure weapon is now almost complete. With the NATO missile defense system on Russia’s doorstep – the threat to international security is very real; not that you would know it via mainstream Murdoch media. In 2002, the United States unilaterally and without consultation, withdrew from the landmark Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. President George W. Bush noted that the treaty is “now behind us,” describing the ABM Treaty as a Cold War relic. Signed in 1972, the ABM Treaty barred both the US and the USSR from deploying national defenses against long-range ballistic missiles. The treaty was based on the premise that if either superpower constructed a strategic defense, the other would build up its offensive nuclear forces to offset the defense. The superpowers would therefore quickly be put on a path toward a never-ending offensive-defensive arms race, as each tried to balance its counterpart’s actions. Until Bush took office, the Treaty was referred to as a “cornerstone of strategic stability” because it facilitated later agreements, reducing U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals. The US, assuming that a weakened Russia will never again be in a position to counter US hegemonic power, proceeded to encroach on Russia’s borders through its manipulation of NATO objectives. Today, there is no instrument in international law that prevents the possibility of mutually assured destruction. Putin has been sending out warnings for over 10 years – all of which fell on deaf ears. Who will push the button first? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT6M48S	408	2d	hd	false		88	0	1	0	0

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Western neoliberal ideology attempts to destroy all that is of conservative or traditional values. Where there is no consensus and no national interests – it is easier to pass almost any legislation at all. While Europeans have already, for the most part, been robbed and guilt-tripped out of their unique identities – the same template tends to backfire when applied to Russia. In 2012- 2013, the punk band “Pussy Riot” took on the role of a marionette of Western propaganda against the Russian state. Its mandate was to attack the ”human rights record” of the Russian government and as such, help paint Vladimir Putin as a “dictator” – by now, a fully absorbed aspect of CIA vernacular, espoused onto the American public. In 2012, the members of Pussy Riot stormed into a Moscow cathedral, defaming the government, while mocking the beliefs of churchgoers with vulgarity and disruptive behaviour. They received a 2 year sentence in the process, but were released early in 2013 – only to cause a scene at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Having completed their task, they went on to CNN to interview about their ordeal. Any person with at least a half a brain understands, that if they were free to do this (the CNN interview took place in their home, in Russia) – then their allegations of not living in a free country, is contrary to logic. The Pussy Riot performance was marketed as an act of “freedom of expression” by the Western media, but constituted what would be called both a religious hate-crime and disorderly conduct in any Western country. Similar cases have played out in the West, where perceived violation of free speech of bigots, racists, and hooligans resulted in very harsh penalties. The double standards here are obscene. If that wasn’t sufficient, Pussy Riot had received direct funding from the National Endowment of Democracy (NED, a Soros “NGO”) – which, receives its funds from the US State Department. In turn, the NED is not an NGO at all, but a not-so-covert tool of infiltration into the civil society of a sovereign state. Soros’ NED was kicked out of Russia in 2015, to the woeful cries of CNN “-There is no freedom of expression under Vladimir Putin!” Put a sock in it, Amanpour. And by the way, CNN host Christiane Amanpour's husband, James Rubin, used to work for the US State Department, which provides funds to the NED! Nothing incestuous here folks, move right along....

Naturally, we closely followed the voting but never interfered or sought to influence it. Therefore, British Prime Minister David Cameron’s statements on Russia’s position before the referendum had no grounds whatsoever. I think it was an inappropriate attempt to influence public opinion at home. As we can see, it did not work. In my opinion, it is all the more inappropriate to speak about Russia’s supposed position after the voting. This is truly a low level of political discourse. Now, to address the core issue. Of course, this will have consequences for both Britain and Europe as a whole. The referendum campaign and subsequent results point to the British Government’s self-assuredness and supercilious attitude to life-changing decisions in their own country and Europe in general. It will have global effects. Again, they are inevitable – both positive and negative. Needless to say, everything will settle back to normal in the mid-term. Time will tell whether there will be more pluses or minuses. It seems to me that ordinary British citizens understand why this happened. First, nobody wants to feed and subsidise weaker economies and pay support other states and entire nations. This is an obvious fact. Apparently, people are displeased about security, which is being eroded by powerful migration waves. People want to be more independent. One of the EU leaders – a former leader—told me that the ratio of binding decisions adopted by the European Parliament is higher than made by the USSR Supreme Soviet in relation to Soviet republics. This means that the concentration of power at the top there is very high. Some like it and want to continue down this road of erasing national borders, whereas others do not like it. Judging by everything, by the results of the voting, the overwhelming majority of British subjects do not like it. It does not suit them. However, I would like to reiterate what I said recently at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. This is the choice made by British subjects. We did not interfere, are not interfering and will not interfere in this in any way. From all indications, certain formal procedures will follow, related to the British people’s decision to leave the EU. We will closely watch and analyse this, seeking to minimise whatever negative fallout this decision might have for our economy, because considering the blow it dealt to markets and currencies, it is bound to impact and is already impacting stock exchange indices and therefore the prices of our traditional goods, but I am sure that everything will fall into place in the very near future. We do not expect a global upheaval as a result. Of course, as I said, we will be closely monitoring things, adjusting our economic policy and adjusting our relations with our European partners. Regarding the sanctions policy, I do not think that this will in any way impact our relations with the EU in this regard. We were not the ones who initiated these sanctioned restrictions on both sides. We only responded to the restrictions that were imposed on our country. I would like to reiterate that if our partners are ever ready for constructive dialogue on these issue, we are also ready. We are not only ready – we seek it and will respond positively to positive initiatives, but we cannot be expected to do certain things that are beyond the scope of our powers. We all know that these restrictions are supposedly tied to the implementation of the Minsk agreements but the key aspects of the implementation of the Minsk agreements today are in the hands of our Kiev partners, in the hands of the Kiev authorities.

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Putin dismisses officials following their election as Russian Academy of Sciences members Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed a number of senior high-ranking officials of the federal security service FSB, presidential property management department, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry, the Kremlin’s press-service said. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision followed the election of the officials in question as corresponding members or full members of the Russian Academy of Sciences in defiance of recommendations from the head of state to the contrary. "Yes, this is true," Peskov said when asked if the dismissal followed their election as Academy of Sciences’ members. The president dismissed the chief of the registration and archive funds directorate of the federal security service FSB, Lieutenant-General Vasily Khristoforov from his post and military service for age reasons. Deputy chief of the presidential property management directorate, head of the presidential property management directorate’s main medical department Konstantin Kotenko, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry’s main military medical directorate Aleksandr Fisun and Deputy Interior Minister, head of the Interior Ministry’s investigations department Aleksandr Savenkov were dismissed of their own accord. At a meeting of the presidential council for science and education last week President Putin asked Russian Academy of Sciences President Vladimir Fortov why several senior officials had been elected as RAS members in defiance of his objections. Putin he was going to give such officials "a chance to dedicate themselves to science, as their research activity look far more important to them than their routine administrative duties at their posts in bodies of power and management." The president said that in defiance of his instructions several officials of the presidential property management department, Education Ministry, Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, federal security service FSB and a number of other agencies participated in the elections. The RAS has told TASS fourteen senior officials, including the chief of the Defense Ministry’s main military medical directorate Aleksandr Fisun had become its members this year. The elections of RAS members ended on October 28 this year. The candidatures of 176 newly-elected full members and 323 new corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences were approved. The title of RAS member can be rejected only if the scientist declares this intention in advance and the motion is supported by a majority at a general meeting of the Academy. The next RAS general meeting is due at the end of March 2017.

The US-funded government coup in the Ukraine was about preventing the economic integration of the Eurasian Union, that could rival that of the EU and its Atlanticist masters. Russia spent 19 years with the WTO to come to a fair consensus in regard to its various trade agreements, of which Ukraine was one of its main trading partners. Does the US care about international law, or even the rule of law? Only as a front to the media, which sells such "values" to the citizenry. Putin alluded to the potential economic reintegration of Ukraine and Russia back in 2010. However, the US quickly instigated the Kiev coup in 2014, where all of the aforementioned agreements were thrown out the window, and to be replaced with US goods and services. I doubt you heard about any of this in The Guardian, or the other loudmouth media outlets. The Ukraine was once a powerhouse of the Soviet Union, producing wheat and grains for the entire superpower of 300+ million people. Today, the Ukraine is about to be turned into a GMO dumping ground by Western companies, at the discretion of Poroshenko- nee Waltzman. I call this a “check” on behalf of Western powers to Putin – but the “mate” is yet to come. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT7M30S	450	2d	hd	false		1	0	0	0	0

You are boosting Trump in it. What is your actual preference? You have been asked many times – Clinton or Trump? And one more question: the US Vice President said recently that we cannot influence the US election results. Frankly, are we even trying to interfere? Do we even need to? Vladimir Putin: What did he say, precisely? We cannot fundamentally affect them. So the reporter needed to press him: not fundamentally, or not at all? He seemed to be acknowledging that we actually could play a role, but I would like to reassure you all, including our American partners and friends: we have no plans to influence the election campaign in the United States. The answer is very simple: we do not know what will happen after the US President is elected. Ms Clinton chose her aggressive rhetoric and aggressive stance with regard to Russia, and Mr Trump, on the contrary, is calling for cooperation, at least against terrorism. We will certainly welcome anyone who wants to work with us, and no, we are not interested in quarrelling constantly with anyone, which only creates threats to oneself and the world, or at the very least makes it harder to achieve the desired results in the fight against terrorism. We do not know what will happen after the election. We do not know whether or not presidential candidate Trump will follow through on his intentions, how far he will go in cooperation with us, whether Ms Clinton will stick to her harsh anti-Russian rhetoric if she is elected President, or maybe she will also adjust her position. We cannot know this now. I will repeat this again: sacrificing Russian-American relations for the sake of internal political events in the US is harmful and counterproductive. This is not the first time. Look at all the previous election campaigns – it’s the same story again and again, as I said. And then they whisper in our ear: “Just wait it out. This will pass, and things will go back to normal.” You know, this is not even funny anymore. But if someone wants a confrontation, it is not our choice. Confrontation means problems. We do not want that. On the contrary, we would like to find common ground and work together to address global challenges facing Russia and the United States and the world.

But this rhetoric has no racist inclination; it is a misunderstanding arising from the Russian language. The word "Russians" has two meanings - it is both those who are Russian ethnically, and those who live in Russia historically (in the West, these groups would be called "indigenous peoples" but you would have a hard time telling an ethnically-Russian/Slavic person that they are not indigenous =))). As a rule of thumb, every Russian considers themselves "indigenous" - its "colonisation" history is not as fresh as it is in the countries of European colonisation. ) Russia is home to over 120 numerically small (many under 50,000 each) local ethnicities. Many have retained their languages and traditions, as well as being citizens of the Russian Federation and speaking Russian fluently. What is important to understand when Putin says "Russia is for Russians" is that it means he puts the rights of all of Russia's many ethnicities before those of immigrants - those immigrants who are culturally and historically not a part of the Russian Federation. This concept is most easily understood in employment - if your country does not have full employment, yet is exercising very liberal immigration policies - then it is not looking after the interests of the people, but those of Capitalism [cheap labour.] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT8M47S	527	2d	hd	false		1	0	0	0	0

This was specified by Putin and Defense Minister Shoigu the day before the Conference, at the Ministry of Defense Board meeting (linked at 2.47). President Putin drew attention to the fact that it was the United States that unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty 1972, a linchpin to international security, precipitating a new arms race.

Putin insinuated that they may fired if they are found to be moonlighting as academics. In the past few months, Putin has been taking a tough line on errant bureaucrats. Several senior officials have been fired, while the Economic Minister, Alexei Ulyukayev, has been detained on a charge of a $2 million bribe. "Drain the swamp" is a catch phrase from the Trump campaign, aimed at eliminating corruption from Washington. Text from The Saker: "The truth is that the members of the Academy of Science are elected for life and they receive large monthly payments, for life. The idea is that scientists should dedicate themselves to their research - that’s why they are paid by the government. There are limited number of memberships available, about 800. The government officials are hence abusing their power, forcing themselves into the science community, and taking places from the real scientists. This is also how they aid foreign governments in thier efforts to destroy Russian science. Don’t be fooled by Putin’s calm demeanour. Next we will see many apparatchiks going down. Fingers crossed, Medvedev will be one of them."

I know that you are now going through hard times and would not like to take part in any official meetings or conversations. Please forgive me for inviting you here at such a difficult moment but I wanted very much to shake your hand and thank you for your son. He was a real hero, which is why yesterday I signed an executive order awarding him the Star of the Hero of the Russian Federation. He is a hero because far from every person remains committed to his oath and duty and to his people, to the point of risking his life in the face of gunfire. Only cowards can shoot an unarmed person, only cowards. And only real heroes, real men like the son you brought up, can look death in the eyes without fear. This is an example for many of us. And his words “Do your duty, brothers” is an order to all his fellow officers. I am deeply indebted to you. I recall how Dagestani militiamen fought against terrorism when they faced this threat. He is a hero of that order. I know that no words can alleviate your grief, of course. However, I want you to know that the people of Moscow and Russia, all people who have a heart, a conscience and any sense at all, understand very well what happened. All of us, and you should know this. Again, I am deeply indebted to you, and I thank you so much for your son.	25	News & Politics	PT5M27S	327	2d	hd	false		3	0	0	0	0

Could the Middle East be left alone, and not pillaged for oil, sending millions of refugees into Europe, creating an unprecedented cultural catastrophe in waiting? Could certain players on the global arena stop financing terror groups abroad, thus removing the threat entirely? But wait, there's more - Mr Putin is not calling for war with "the others", because only WE are the good guys? Unlike Nobel Peace Prize holder over there. None of which is happening in the world today is an accident. It is a planned and implemented strategy. Putin refers to these as "mistakes of the West" - but this is diplomatic-speak.

Which ones stand out as the most glamorous in today's world? Why of course -the international banks and financial institutions. All countries live in debt, albeit to much larger proportions in the West - but to whom? A handful of fat cat CEOs. In this quick outtake, Putin talks about the state of the international economy. The key point to take away is that the US prints fiat money, backed by nothing more than thin air, while the national debt level only gets larger (19 trillion!) The only way this situation can change is through the imposition of a parallel financial system that steers away from the US dollar as the reserve currency. Gaddafi attempted to do this in his time, through the use of the gold backed dinar. Russia and China are the only ones left that at time times allude to the possibility of a world in which the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. In theory, such a system would dismantle the 500 year old Rothschild Empire. The empire that continually sponsors both sides of wars in order to keep the sheeple occupied.

They are two irreconcilable world views. I don’t believe there is a right or wrong, but there are as many opinions on this subject as there are people in the world. However, it is true that many Russians hold Western values in contempt, and resist being subjugated to them. Deserved or not, the West is often perceived as a faithless and individualistic society with an exceptional love of money. The pop culture that arrives on Russian TV screens is often looked down upon for its over-sexualised content. Cultural phenomena such as ‘twerking’ are not really understood. Further examples can include the often misogynistic rap culture, the overemphasis on all things stupid (are you keeping up with the Kardashians?), the devaluing of the family unit as the foundation of society, the mascularisation of women, the demasculation of men, the ability to have no gender (I mean, what?), and the list goes on. This is not to feed the opinions of the libertards who scream “Putin banned homosexuality!” He did no such thing and homosexuals live and work in Russia like any other, with no restrictions on any of their civil liberties. What did occur is the ban on “propaganda for homosexuality” to children and teenagers, which is overt and often vulgar. (For example, why is it that a gay parade, for around 1% of the population, can be held on taxpayer money, otherwise known as the majority of the population, but also behave in a way that a group of heterosexual people never could in public?) The point is not that homosexuals should not exist – they can and happily do! The point is that the minority groups should not force their choices on to the majority of the population. Russia's Roskomnadzor (The Federal Service for Supervision of Information Technologies and Mass Communications) has banned websites such as PornHub, as it violated laws surrounding porn distribution and child protection. Similarly, 136 other adult websites were also banned from being accessed in Russia – all of which can easily be viewed by children in any Western country. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT3M25S	205	2d	hd	false		9	0	0	0	0

Russia Beyond The Headlines has compiled some of Putin’s best (or worst) comedic moments. In true Russian style, most of his jokes are anekdoty, literally ‘anecdotes’ or little stories. "I told this oldie-but-goodie before, and can't help but tell it again. Well, there once was a pessimist and an optimist. The pessimist was drinking cognac, and said, 'This smells like bedbugs!' The optimist grabbed a bedbug from the wall, sniffed it and said, 'Well, doesn’t this smell a bit like cognac!' "My point is, I’d rather be a pessimist who drinks cognac, than an optimist who sniffs bedbugs. Even if the optimist lives a little more happily…" "I don’t get why Germans don’t like nuclear energy. I don’t want to comment on it, but… I don’t understand how you’re going to keep warm. You don’t want gas, and you don’t want to develop nuclear energy, so what are you going to do, burn firewood? Of course, though, you’d have to get the wood from Siberia…" Angela Merkel is rather unimpressed with Putin’s jokes: "There are all sorts of jokes on this matter…as in, no matter how you act on your wedding night, the result should always be the same. Get it?" When asked whether he thought the economic crisis was over in Russia, Putin responded with a joke: "I’ll tell you an old anecdote of ours: two friends meet up, and one asks the other: Putin tells an old anekdot from Soviet times about bureaucratic unpredictability and the whims of Russian officialdom: A spy goes to Lubyanka (headquarters of the Soviet secret police in Moscow) and says In the aftermath of the US election the leftists have blamed their loss on everything but their own incompetence and criminality. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his bewilderment at why European countries were taking in so many migrants given the increasing number of rapes sweeping the continent, asserting that a society which cannot protect its children “has no future”. President-elect Trump on Friday hailed a “very nice” holiday letter he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose thoughts he said are “so correct.” Putin Russia Jokes Fun Funny Comedy "Funny Jokes" comedian Russian World Diplomat Diplomatic "United States" USA America Europe European "European Union" politics news media entertainment trends trendy interview tv "tv show" conference mic microphone 2016 2017 humanity future history historic question truth russka language translation "elite nwo agenda" smile In the letter, sent ahead of Christmas and released by the Trump transition team, Putin called the relationship between Russia and the United States “an important factor in ensuring stability and security of the modern world.” Russia will no longer play games and engage in back-room negotiations over trifles. But Russia is prepared for serious conversations and agreements, if these are conducive to collective security, are based on fairness and take into account the interests of each side. During his annual address to Russian lawmakers, President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is ready for dialogue with its international partners, but will not allow them to infringe on its interests or meddle in its decision-making. “We will not allow any infringement on the interests of the Russian Federation and we will manage our own destiny without tips and unsolicited advice,” the Russian leader said. He noted, however, that Russia is ready to participate in solving global and regional crises when necessary. “We understand the extent of our responsibility and are sincerely willing to take part in solving global and regional problems, of course, where our involvement is appropriate, necessary, and in demand,” the president stated.	25	News & Politics	PT14M1S	841	2d	hd	false		2	0	0	0	0

The work at the G20 summit in China was fruitful, and reflected interests of all countries including Russia, President Putin said Monday. Vladimir Putin spoke about his hope for a full restoration of 'normalized Russia-US relations', an agreement on the Syrian crisis, the need for compromise in the matter of the Kuril Islands, and the future of UK-Russian ties. Russia maintains dialogue with the United States and Turkey over the Syrian crisis, President Putin told reporters, suggesting that the sides could agree on mutual steps to improve the situation. Japan and Russia have never signed a permanent peace treaty after World War II due to a disagreement over four islands, which Russia calls the Southern Kurils and Japan the Northern Territories. The disputed islands, located in the Sea of Okhotsk, were claimed by Soviet forces at the end of the war. "Creating an enabling environment to address any issues, including the conclusion of the peace treaty is extremely important," Putin told reporters, adding that it was necessary for the sides to continue looking for compromises. Leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies gathered in Hangzhou on Sunday for a two-day summit that focuses on how to build an innovative, invigorated, interconnected and inclusive world economy.

Why, be historically inaccurate of course! Every educated person knows that before the USSR invaded Poland in 1939 [Molotov-Ribentropp pact] - Poland invaded Czechoslovakia, in cahoots with Hitler [Munich Agreement, 1938.] The Molotov-Ribentropp pact has been publicly condemned by the modern Russian parliament, and brought down to being a personal pact between Hitler and Stalin themselves, rather than any will of the people. Yet Russia continues to serve the "Russian aggression" myth to this day - without recourse to the fact that Poland had sided with Hitler beforehand. If you're going to "pick out the raisins" from a mouldy bread bun, and leave the mould out for the other party - that other party best not be Mr. Putin :) The current governments of Eastern Europe are unfortunately historically forgetful vassals, sucking at the NATO/US dollar teat. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT3M29S	209	2d	hd	false		1	0	0	0	0

It "exposed" a number of high profile individuals to tax evasion practices, hiding their money in overseas accounts. However, there was more to it than met the untrained eye. It is still murky waters as to what actually occurred with this fake ‘leak’ project – the most likely circumstance is that US officials purchased certain selections of the information directly from Mossack Fonseca. There are few North American or European businessmen that have been "outed" - except the Icelandic PM, who was one of few politicians to jail bankers. Hmmm. Vladimir Putin failed to come up in any direct implication to tax evasion – however Mr Poroshenko did not, not that Western media picked up on that. The ‘leaks’ were published via the “International Consortium of Investigative Journalists”, which are, and no surprises here, a Soros initiative. Even though Putin was not linked, his picture in conjunction with the allegations traversed the globe like wildfire. Much like the MH17 “evidence” of “Putin’s missile”, the Guardian and other such fanatically-Russophobic sources continue to feed the feeble minded of the Western world. Overall, it is the intention of the US to paint Vladimir Putin, an irritant to the hegemony, as self-enriching and pro-oligarch (see “Putin’s $2 billion wealth” type articles) However – as an example, it is little known that the parasite Mr. Khodorkovsy was not only guilty of embezzlement and money laundering, but he was about to sell Gazprom to the Americans. The Russian government intervened - which explains Khodorkovsky's antipathy towards Putin, and makes much sense than the tall tales he tells on CNN. Gazprom is Russia’s largest natural gas producer, which Khodorkovsky stole from the Russian people for mere pennies, in the early 1990s. If you have not caught on by now – the Western reader - everything that your media writes in regard to Putin, the opposite is likely true.

Putin was not in the car at the time, though Russian media report that the president’s official driver was killed in the crash. Medics are said to have arrived quickly on the scene, but the unnamed victim — who had more than 40 years’ driving experience — died instantly. The presidential car is officially registered as belonging to the Federation Council — Russia’s equivalent of the House of Lords. Under the title "Did the neocon criminal cabal just send a message to President Vladimir Putin?", The Millennium Report claimed it was an "audacious threat" to Putin. It went on to claim it was the work of a group of foreign secret service agents who had "proxies" operating inside Moscow. The online blog claimed the mysterious group pulling the strings would stop at nothing to bring down Putin and his leadership of Russia. Leonid Reshetnikov is Director of an influential think tank, the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS), and a retired lieutenant general of Russia's foreign intelligence service. Andrey Afanasyev: Some experts say that the incident in Syria was not just an effort to provoke Russia, but to involve it in a global conflict. Are today’s American or their elites in favor of this? Leonid Reshetnikov: We need to take into account that Americans like using well-tested methods. This was the scheme they used in Syria, where they just signed a truce; Russia is busy with elections, no one expects an attack, so they think they’ll probably get away with it: “We’ll see how Russia responds”. They did the same thing in Georgia on August 8, 2008, thinking it would go unnoticed because of the Olympics, and Russia would not dare respond... There’s nothing surprising here; it’s a typical US Special Services/military job. I think they mainly want to save their country in its role of Master of the Universe, which they are losing. They feel their weakness better than we do, aware that most countries no longer want to continue as obedient stooges, either morally, or spiritually, or politically. Now they have the only one option – hit the enemy to show their force – maybe he will back off. This would start with removing our president…. Andrey Afanasyev: Some are even talking about assassination… Leonid Reshetnikov: The Central Intelligence Agency specializes in assassination. They’ve been practicing it for decades, assassinating leaders around the world. That’s why it would be naïve to think that they’re not planning to do the same with Vladimir Putin: if they can’t remove him from power they will assassinate him. The second goal is to blockade Russia, involve it in various conflicts. Unlike when Turkey shot down a Russian plane, they think we would take the bait. The policy in Syria is the same: You have to respond. We should have no illusions. Today’s United States of America is interested only in one thing – destroying Russia as a civilizational, geopolitical, military and political rival — as well as an economic rival, with its treasure trove of resources.

President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he did not dispute that the US military was the world’s most powerful and that US President-elect Donald Trump’s statement about the need to boost his country’s nuclear weapons capability was perfectly normal. Trump on Thursday called for an expansion of the United States’ nuclear capabilities, in a tweet that alarmed non-proliferation experts who said that a boost to the US arsenal could fuel global tensions. Putin told a news conference in Moscow on Friday he was surprised by the fuss Trump’s tweet had caused and how it had been linked to his own statements about Russia’s plans to modernise its own nuclear arsenal. Putin said on Thursday Russia’s military was “stronger than any potential aggressor.” Putin made clear on Friday he did not regard the United States as a potential aggressor. “I was a bit surprised by the statements from some representatives of the current US administration who for some reason started to prove that the US military was the most powerful in the world,” said Putin. “Nobody is arguing with that.” He said Trump’s statement about overhauling US nuclear forces was “nothing special.” “He (Trump) spoke during his election campaign about the need to beef up the US nuclear arsenal and the armed forces,” said Putin.

The comment comes a week after a heated row broke out over Russia's use of its UN Security Council veto against a French resolution calling for a halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The tensions saw Putin cancel a long-planned visit to Paris on October 19, after French President Francois Hollande accused Syrian troops of committing war crimes in Aleppo with Russian support. "France is not so deeply involved in the settlement of the Syrian conflict," Putin said at a press conference on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in India. "We remember when the (French) Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier approached the coast of Syria - and we had seemingly agreed to work jointly - but a few days later it turned away and headed toward the Suez Canal," Putin said. "What does that say?" he added. Putin said the French authorities had decided that the purpose of his Paris visit - the opening of an Orthodox cultural centre - was no longer "suitable for a joint event" given the circumstances in Syria. "We have other issues apart from Syria, we could have discussed other issues," he said. Earlier in the week Putin had accused France of pushing for a UN proposal on Syria knowing Russia would veto it, saying the move was aimed at "inflaming the situation and fanning hysteria around Russia". Putin said today that Russia was "always ready to talk with everyone" on ways to end the five-year conflict, "especially large and great powers like France with all its capabilities" Keep us alive: http://russia-insider.com/support Visit us! http://russia-insider.com/en Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RussiaInsider?ref=aymt_homepage_panel Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RussiaInsider	25	News & Politics	PT2M3S	123	2d	hd	false		85	1	0	0	0

The Russian leader said that it's not about any third side in particular, but relations worsen because "one country" wants to impose its policy and decisions upon the rest of the world. "We are not against this country, but we oppose that decisions are made on a unilateral basis and are not thought through considering historic, cultural and religious peculiarities of one country or another," even if there is a conflict within the affected nation, Putin said.

In Iraq, they do not know how to fight the terrorist groups and now there is a possibility of a battle to re-conquer the important city of Mosul, while Libya is no longer a state, added the Russian president. They (the United States) do not like others to have different positions, pointed out Putin at a meeting with Russian reporters in New Delhi at the end of a summit of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). We have examples of that, he said. Was it I who turned the plane back in mid flight to suspend a visit to Washington in March 1999, when the NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, Putin asked. Then Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov suspended his visit when he knew that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had launched air strikes on Belgrade under the pretext of stopping an alleged ethnic cleansing. Putin recalled that late President Boris Yeltsin was a positive character to the West while he did not assume a position of defense of national interests in the case of Yugoslavia. The president was responding to a question about whether Russia would be unwise to ease tensions with the United States and avoid actions such as sending military ships to the Mediterranean Sea	25	News & Politics	PT3M7S	187	2d	hd	false		38	1	0	0	1

The Forum is taking place this year under the theme of Sustaining Confidence in a World Undergoing Transformation. (23th May 2014) Geoff Cutmore: If I could just ask one more question on this situation now with Washington: Did President Obama misunderstand the depth of feeling in Russia about Ukraine and the situation there, or was the relationship already breaking down over things like the Snowden affair? Vladimir Putin: Speaking of Snowden, I said it before many times. Technically, we have nothing to do with this. He happened to end up in Russia due, in my opinion, to the lack of professionalism of the US officials that tried to apprehend him. I know because I used to work for the security services. Why did they have to scare the entire world? If they were willing to force planes with presidents on board to land, they could have forced the plane with Mr Snowden to land anywhere. They scared the whole world. The plane arrived in our transit area and then nobody wanted to accept it. If the US security services had not scared everyone, the plane would have taken off and flown to any country. They would have forced it to land and Snowden would be sitting in a zindan or some other prison. But they scared everyone and he stayed in our transit area. What were we supposed to do? Russia is not a country that extradites fighters for human rights. (Applause) Thank you for this response. It’s true, I’m not being ironic. Mr Snowden believes he is fighting for human rights and he has devoted his life to this. He is very young. I don’t know how he is going to live. I’m not kidding. How is he going to live? For now, he is in Russia. But then what? He chose this fate himself, you see? We only gave him asylum. He is not our agent. He did not give away any secrets, although the rascal really should have given us something – we gave him asylum after all. But he won’t tell us anything. He uses channels that only he knows of and makes statements when he thinks it’s necessary, and that’s it.	25	News & Politics	PT2M5S	125	2d	hd	false		15	0	0	0	0

However, it gave Western mainstream media a chance to create some stories around "Russia's blackmail" and "skyrocketing prices" for Ukraine's energy needs. In this video, Putin explains that the Russian-Ukrainian energy supply relationship was established long before the US Establishment had any interest in it whatsoever. So butt out please. Similarly, Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, now sits on the board of Ukraine's largest gas producing company, Burisma.

Putin noted that US threats of hack attacks do not correspond to the norms of international relations. "The only novelty is that for the first time, on the highest level, the United States has admitted involvement in these activities, and to some extent threatened [us] – which of course does not meet the standards of international communication,” the Russian leader said. “Apparently, they are nervous,” he added. US Vice President Joe Biden said on Friday that Washington is ready to respond to hack attacks it claims were conducted by Russia and designed to interfere with the upcoming US election. “We are sending a message [to Putin],” Biden told NBC. “He’ll know it. It will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact,” the US vice president said. Biden’s threats coincided with reports that the CIA is planning a “clandestine” cyberattack on Russia, in retaliation for its alleged efforts to influence the US election against Hillary Clinton. “One can expect just about anything from our American friends. After all, what did he (Biden) say that we didn’t already know? Didn’t we know that US authorities are spying and eavesdropping on everyone?” These activities are “well known to everyone, it’s no secret,” Putin added. In portraying Russia as an enemy, the United States wants to divert attention from its own domestic problems. “There are many problems [in the US], and in these circumstances, many choose to resort to the tried and tested system of diverting voters’ attention from their own problems. That’s what we are currently witnessing, I think.” One can distract attention from domestic problems by creating an enemy, in order “to unite the nation in the fight against this enemy.” “Portraying Iran and the Iranian nuclear threat as an enemy didn’t work. [Portraying] Russia [as an enemy] seems more interesting. In my opinion, this particular card is now being actively played,” Putin said. “Too bad that based on the current [US] internal political problems, Russia-US relations are being sacrificed. This actually destroys international relations in general,” Putin noted. It is almost as if US intelligence officials are daring themselves to do something that may turn out to be quite destructive for everybody, Jim Jatras, former GOP Senate foreign policy adviser, told... Russia does not want confrontation with the US, but it is up to our partners to decide, he said. “We do not know what will happen after the US elections, but welcome everyone who wants to work with us,” he said. Speaking about the US election campaign, Putin noted that it is “harmful and counterproductive” to “sacrifice US-Russian relations in the course of internal political events in America.” This has all happened before, Putin noted. “Analyze all previous election campaigns [in the US] – it all repeats over and over again, like I’ve said. And then we have people whispering to us, ‘Oh, wait, wait, it’ll be over soon, things will go back to normal,’” Putin said. “It’s not even funny anymore. But if someone wants a confrontation – this is not our choice, and it means that there will be some problems. We don’t want that. We would like, on the contrary, to seek common ground and work together to solve global problems faced by both Russia and the United States, along with the whole world,” Putin concluded. Russia is not going to influence the election campaign in the United States, because it does not know what will happen after the elections. “I hope that after the election period in the US, there will be a chance to restore relations between Moscow and Washington,” Putin said.

Why is this happening? Because Russia is destroying billions of dollars worth of US investment into trained jihadists, with the view that they would eventually take down the legitimate government of Syria. Moreover, the US operation in Mosul is questionable - they say they're fighting ISIS but reports are conflicting. In this clip, Putin notes that when it comes to winning - we could learn from Israel. It never gives up its position and doesn't let things slide. They say that Middle Eastern "dictators" rule with an "iron fist" - but how does Israel rule, if not with an iron fist? (Do not turn this around to mean that Putin supports the Gaza occupation - it is a separate question all together. ) This comment should only be considered in context to fighting off terrorists from the region.

Vladimir Putin asked the US to remove its defense infrastructure from Eastern Europe and from the territory of new NATO members in the Balkans and the Baltics (Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland) as well as its troops stationed there in recent years. He also insists that Washington’s sanction are lifted and compensation paid for the damage caused by them. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the termination of the plutonium processing agreement with the US, for hostile action by Washington against Russia and he set several conditions for its renewal – first, a “reduction of military infrastructure and the size of US contingent troops located in NATO countries who became members after September 1, 2000, to the level at which they were on the day of this agreement entering into force.” “In relation with the radical change of circumstances, a threat to the strategic stability arises as a result of hostile actions of the United States of America toward the Russian Federation, and the inability of the US to ensure the implementation of commitments in the processing of excess plutonium for weapons purposes in accordance with international contracts” is stated in the official document, which terminated the agreement. The agreement with the US was signed on August 29, 2000, and applies to the processing of excess plutonium for weapons purposes in Russia and the USA. Each party must take action to eliminate plutonium with a total weight of 34 tons. Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow sends a signal to Washington with its decision, that the US will not achieve anything by talking with Russia from a position of power, sanctions and ultimatums. This is a forced measure, but the Russian Foreign Minister stated that Russia is not abdicating its responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, according to material published on the website of the Ministry. Reuters also reported that Vladimir Putin terminated the agreement with the US for the disposal of plutonium from nuclear warheads. The agency notes that this is another indication of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow. The decree noted that the deal was terminated because of “the resultant threat to strategic stability and due to the hostilities of the United States toward the Russian Federation”. The US proved unable to fulfill their obligations to the contract. The exact reason to terminate the agreement is the American method of processing the plutonium. The agreement call for the nuclear material to be processed “irreversibly”. Since 2010, the US stopped processing “irreversibly” and has only been burying the material, enabling them to produce nuclear munitions uncontrollably. The draft law to stop the agreement also stated that the agreement will be renewed by decision of President Vladimir Putin, who is also a drafter of this text. But first, the US would have to “remove the causes that led to the fundamental change of circumstances.” Moscow requires an “end of the hostile policy towards the Russian Federation through”: – A repeal of the “Magnitsky” Law from 2012, through which dozens of officials deemed responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky in prison, are banned from entering the United States. – A repeal of targeted against Russia provisions, in the Act of 2014 to support freedom in Ukraine. – A removal of all sanctions introduced by the United States to natural and legal persons from Russia. – A compensation for the damages caused to the Russian Federation as a result of the imposed sanctions, including damages caused by the (Russian) counter-sanction	25	News & Politics	PT8M12S	492	2d	hd	false		92	0	0	0	1

There is the simple concept of national interests, which may or may not be at odds with other countries. Diplomacy is the art of being able to reconcile your national interests, alongside those of other States, compromising on certain aspects along the way. However, the Atlanticist world view (EU/US/NATO) has shown not to allow for mutual respect, nor for cooperation. Through a number of covert means, they ask for nothing less than for Russia to no longer ascertain its national interests, which makes President Putin #1 Boogeyman in the world today. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT1M19S	79	2d	hd	false		10	0	0	0	0

My view is that these concepts are used interchangeably by different people – and while I do not know Putin’s definition of ideology, I do think that America’s ideology is part of what forms it culture, as in Russia. In this clip, Putin covers an astounding amount of ground in 5 minutes; individualism/collectivism, the formation of the United States as a democracy, ethnic cleansing of native Americans, and the Stalin era of the Soviet regime. But the overall message, in my interpretation, is that Americans are selfish. Just kidding =)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) This is more of a philosophical view on things, for you to ponder over. Of course, the United States remains the only country to have ever utilised nuclear weapons, while pointing the finger at everyone else for being a dictator, and condemning histories that aren't theirs (ie. Stalin vs. Genocide of Native Americans) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT5M8S	308	2d	hd	false		3	0	0	0	0

Currently, the Ukraine is unable to join NATO due to internal conflict - the absence of which is a prerequisite for new members. It would seem then that stopping the US-initiated war in Eastern Ukraine would be beneficial to US interests - or, are they fully aware, that this most certainly will not be allowed to happen as a direct threat to Russia's security? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For current affairs, translations and analysis, check out http://www.Fort-Russ.com My vids also get uploaded to the Eurasia Daily page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eurasiadaily.nz/	25	News & Politics	PT6M23S	383	2d	hd	false		72	0	0	0	0

And Assassinate Donald Trump threats go viral on Twitter. Donald Trump accepts his rightful position as the 45th President-Elect of the United States of America. While Hillary waits. Hillary and company sit in limbo, impossibly rallying faithless electors to throw the Electoral College’s vote. As the pressure of all of her crimes bubbles to the surface of a bog of corruption, President Elect Donald Trump mentioned numerous times that he would assign a special prosecutor to wade into to handle Hillary’s 5 FBI Investigations. One of which, the email investigation, was dropped by Clinton Foundation lackey FBI Director James Comey, strategically setting the stage to allow President Obama to pardon Hillary. Which begs the question, Can a sitting President pardon someone under an investigation that has yet to be convicted of a crime? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Gerald Ford did it for Nixon. And Bill Clinton pardoned CIA Director John Deutch for mishandling classified information. The Charlotte Observer reports “The Constitution says the president can pardon ‘offenses’ against the U.S., not ‘convictions,’” attorney Samuel T. Morison, a pardon specialist, said in an email interview Wednesday. “The only constraint is that he can’t pardon someone in advance of committing the offense.” Of course the allegations against the Clinton Crime family aren’t singular in nature. They include the brazen mishandling of classified materials endangering national security, racketeering on levels the RICO Act was designed to address to the fullest extent of the law, the recent murders of witnesses, child rape allegations related to Bill and Hillary’s numerous visits to Jeffrey Epstein Pedophile Island, and Election Fraud? And just how many politicians and sycophants will be released from prosecution, if the Clinton Foundation walks free? Now as Chelsea Clinton prepares to launch her political career, which will begin with Chelsea's hands dirty with money laundering allegations. The Clinton’s hubris appears to be a stain impossible to wash off. Chelsea seemingly unaware that Americans intend on restoring the Republic to its finally glory, beginning with the prosecution of her family. If Chelsea had a lick of sense, she would beg Cher for a seat on the rocket intended to leave Planet Earth and America’s seed of exponential providence behind.	25	News & Politics	PT4M6S	246	2d	hd	false		25	0	0	0	0

The people who dislike Trump are the ones who are either too scared to hear or accept the truth, or they are plain stupid. What they do not realize is that Trump can make America great again. I, now a member of the Trump Brigade, am going to help you understand why you should support Trump to become the new President of the United States. I hated Trump, but now I love him and support him with all my heart. Trump is a genius who has correctly identified the issues that are preventing America from becoming great again. Trump’s opinion on immigration has struck a chord with many people who understand what he is trying to highlight. Trump’s opinion on Islam and its incompatibility with the American values and culture has forced even his biggest critics to agree with him. Trump’s strategy on how to deal with Iran, Russia, middle-east, etc., is gaining more support with each passing day. Trump’s statements about Mexico and China initially drew a lot of criticism, but they too are supported by millions of people who understand that he is merely trying to help America regain its lost glory. Trump versus Hillary Clinton, his biggest political rival, is proving to be an unfair match because of media trial of Trump. CNN’s biased coverage of Trump’s rallies, and the dishonest reporting of other news channels and media houses is hurting Trump’s chances of becoming US President. A lot of people find Trump’s speeches and statements funny, or his opinions extreme. The truth is that many of these people actually fail to understand the issues that Trump is trying to highlight. Trump is honest and a true genius, and if Trump win US Presidential Elections 2016, even the people who did not vote for him or are criticizing him right now will come to love him after they see him work.

REACTION From A Black Guy	Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO Donald Trump made a campaign stop and gave a speech in Dimondale, Michigan on Friday, August 19th, 2016 in which he made the controversial statement: "You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?" Dimondale, Michigan is a largely white suburb outside of Lansing, although there were non-white people in the crowd, particularly a black woman who stood right behind Trump during his speech and was cheering him on. The statement made at the rally, of course, has been all over most media outlets all day Friday and today, Saturday, as well. It has been all over social media as well, garnering outrage from many black liberals and white liberals alike. In their outrage, none of them ever seem to really address the question he asked or the problems that he brought up. The problems that the black community faces are many... and they are very serious. The black teenage unemployment rate he quoted at 58% is actually much higher than that. Media outlets like CNN try to debunk the number... well not really debunk... they just try to explain it, saying that just because that many black teens are out of work, doesn't mean that they aren't looking for work. Which is a weak attempt at debunking. In reality, the numbers are much worse than that. In a place like Chicago, it's as high as 92% for black male teens aged 16-19, and nationwide it's over 80% for that same demographic. Lousy schools, lack of jobs, and poverty are due in part to the rule of the Democrat party for the past 50 years. The black community is as poor as it's ever been, but the poverty in the black community today is a much worse condition than it was prior to the Democrat plantation. Before 1940, black teen unemployment and white teen unemployment was about the same, and they were both low. Now, black teen unemployment is exponentially higher. Why? Because of the minimum wage law, which was designed to keep lower skilled blacks out of jobs that higher skilled whites would do. Why pay the same amount of money for a lower skilled worker that you could pay for a higher skilled worker? The minimum wage law racial tactic was also implemented in South Africa to keep apartheid entrenched into society, along with labour unions. Liberals, especially high-ranking liberals like Hillary Clinton who called what Trump said at the rally "ignorant" just don't want to admit that their precious Democrat-ran cities feature violent and poverty-stricken black ghettoes. In many ways, those ghettoes exist as the new plantation, growing fodder for private prisons, the mortuary industry, the sex industry, and maybe even sports. To have a person like Trump come along could shake up that balance, and free some of the individuals who are, in essence, trapped on the plantation. And the Democrat slave masters are none too pleased about it. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– If you want to support me to continue to crank out these videos, please visit my website http://www.anthonyblogan.com/contact/ and click on that donate button for me! –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– You can catch me micro-blogging on a near 24/7basis on my social media platforms: http://www.twitter.com/anthonyblogan http://www.facebook.com/lcs.flyers Please take a moment and subscribe to my YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/aloge?sub_confirmation=1 Stay tuned to my website http://www.anthonyblogan.com for more updates as they come in! –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Trump pitches black voters: 'What the hell do you have to lose?' http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/ Donald Trump to black voters: 'What do you have to lose?' http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37135836 Walter E Williams on Black Unemployment http://townhal	25	News & Politics	PT11M22S	682	2d	hd	false		25	0	0	0	2

Something big is going to happen! This is the latest Anonymous message to the global public. Billionaire globalist George Soros has penned a panicked rant in which he decries President-elect Donald Trump as a “would be dictator” who threatens the future of the new world order. With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and the BREXIT vote in Great Britain, a pattern is beginning to emerge. This pattern is indicating that a major take-down of George Soros and his Open Society Foundation, among other organizations, both sub and individual, is in process. George Soros has also been instrumental in manipulating western policy towards Russia and China in general. Panama Papers leaks, the case has been made that George Soros was behind this and the goal was to expose the Rothschild connections throughout the global banking network with the intent of taking control of the global governance process. This attempted coup against the Rothschild’s and the more hidden international banking powers which they represent, is now collapsing and the backlash could very well be violent. The Trump platform represents a direct attack on the organizations and strategies of George Soros. Along with BREXIT, Donald Trump will be enacting policies to reduce and stop immigration from terrorist supporting nations. This can be assumed to be nations that are in alliance with George Soros.

That’s What the Comeback Is?’: Anderson Cooper Slams Trump For His Streep ‘Overrated’ Tweet	Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO During a panel discussion on CNN this evening, host Anderson Cooper indicated that President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet about actress Meryl Streep this morning was a pretty weak comeback. Talking about Streep’s anti-Trump Golden Globes speech, where she hit the incoming POTUS for mocking a disabled reporter, the panel got a bit chaotic when political commentator Kayleigh McEnany suggested that there was dispute over whether Trump actually did that. Following that, and additional discussion over the potentially condescending nature of Streep slamming football and MMA, Cooper wanted to know why Trump reacted and why he gave the reaction he did. “My point is that his comeback is ‘She’s overrated’ is like,” Cooper said. “Really? That’s what the comeback is?” He further noted that for the president-elect “to be such a raw nerve of emotion is amazing to me.” Watch the clip above, via CNN.	25	News & Politics	PT2M47S	167	2d	hd	false		24	0	0	0	0

President-Elect Donald Trump is still casting doubt on Russia’s supposed election hacking, all while teasing that he knows things about it that “other people don’t.” The President-Elect held a brief meeting with his press pool on New Years Eve, where he was asked about how often he dismisses the indications that ers attempted to meddle with the election. Trump said it was “unfair” to blame Russhhuaa for its alleged cybacks, even as President Obama has enacted sanctions against Russia as punishment for their cking. “I just want them to be sure. It’s a pretty serious charge,” Trump said. “I know a lot about cking and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else, and I also know things that other people don’t know, so they cannot be sure of this situation.” When asked about what information he was speaking about, Trump said he would talk about it on Tuesday or Wednesday. As he continued to take questions on cybe se curity, Trump said the best way to guarantee the transmission of secret information was by hand delivery. “I don’t care what they say, no computer is safe. I have a boy who’s 10 years old, he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier.”	25	News & Politics	PT4M2S	242	2d	sd	false		0	0	0	0	0

Trump held a press conference at Trump Tower in New York in the wake of publication of a false intelligence report by BuzzFeed and hyping by CNN the day before. The salacious and proven false allegations they hyped was concerning alleged, but false, bad conduct by Trump on a foreign trip to Moscow, Russia and by his attorney Michael Cohen in Prague, Czech Republic. Trump repudiated the false news as fake news, and refused to take a question from the CNN or perhaps BuzzFeed reporter at his press conference. Do you think Trump acted appropriately in refusing the question?	25	News & Politics	PT2M45S	165	2d	sd	false		0	0	0	0	0

Clinton fordert seit Monaten eine härtere Gangart der USA, plädiert für Aufrüstung, militärische Interventionen und Abschreckung.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York. She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion. ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL Welcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Hillary Clinton Email Investigation FBI Director James Comey testified at a hearing on the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers while serving as secretary of state, as well as the decision to not recommend criminal charges against her. Rep. Gowdy Q&A - Oversight of the State Department. At a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) grilled FBI director James Comey about several of Hillary Clinton‘s statements to the public, which the FBI investigation revealed to be untrue. For instance, Clinton had previously claimed that she had never received or sent classified information to or from her private email server; Comey conceded to Rep. Gowdy that that was not true. Another claim of Clinton’s, which the investigation revealed to be untrue, was that she had retained all work-related emails. Comey noted that they had uncovered “thousands” of work-related emails not returned to the State Department. “In the interest of time and because I have a plane to catch tomorrow afternoon,” Gowdy concluded after running through a catalogue of Clinton’s claims, “I’m not going to go through any more of the false statements.” But Gowdy determined that “false exculpatory statements” can be used to determine intention and consciousness of guilt.	25	News & Politics	PT6M2S	362	2d	sd	false		6	0	0	0	0

Cathy O'Brien - 0:36:50) The Granada Forum, October 31, 1996 On May 7, 1966 a 9 year old child named Cathy O'Brien was subjected to an occult ritual named "The Rite to Remain Silent". This is her own very shocking and eye-opening life story about her experience as a CIA MK-Ultra Whitehouse Pentagon level trauma-based Mind Control slave. She speaks out to expose those who abused, who go right up to presidents and congressmen and women and to give voice to the many mind control victims out there who can't think to speak out. O'Brien claims to have been abused since she was a toddler by her own family. Forced to partake in satanic sadomasochistic child pornography movies produced for Gerald Ford, she was eventually sold to the CIA, which was looking for traumatized children for their mind-control program ...

Please Subscribe Channel Youtube Kids channel: https://goo.gl/CQZKLD Dota 2 gameplay: https://goo.gl/86XUJO August 25, 2016 Hillary Clinton "Rally" as seen through the lens of THREE cell phone cameras... all three cell phone camera screens show proof that the rally itself, was staged! None of the three cameras that are all fixated on the same location, show Hilary Clinton in their frames. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? Why would that be possible? Are the rallies staged completely? Or are the crowds added post-event to give the appearance of a larger crowd? Where are they actually being held? Are they public events? Are the crowd cheers actually real? THIS VIDEO EXPOSES what many have alleged is going on; there are staged Hillary Clinton Rallies... none of them are near in size of what has been reported... this video exposes that there is a real possibility that Hillary is not holding ANY live events, or minimal live events!

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York. She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion. ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL Welcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Even live TV, as you can see from this video. They fixed Paul Walkers scenes that he was unable to shoot in Furious 7 with just a little work compositing his face onto his brothers body. Think about it!!! Watch closely, and when Hillary Collapsed, it looks like the post was holding her up in the first place.... And that she fell all the way to the ground hard. Dont vote for a corpse, This video just proves how dishonest they are. Anyone whos ever done anything in production can recognize fakery immediately...

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York. She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion. ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL Welcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York. She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion. ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL Welcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

It exposes prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. And, it’s all disguised as a duck. In this video, several Project Veritas Action undercover journalists catch Democracy Partners founder directly implicating Hillary Clinton in FEC violations. “In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,” says Creamer in one of several exchanges. “So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.” It is made clear that high-level DNC operative Creamer realized that this direct coordination between Democracy Partners and the campaign would be damning when he said: “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. This latest video takes this investigation even further. First video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJG... Second video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8P...

Clinton accused Trump of undermining democracy if he didn't accept the election results. Trump said he might contest some results, leaving his options available. Well, now Trump is accusing Clinton of undermining democracy and Clinton is leaving her options available. What do you think? Tell us below This is Think Politics: Our belief is that the mainstream media does not work on behalf of the people or democracy. To call them out, we use their own videos as a backdrop to put forth another perspective on the news. In some cases, we might actually agree with whomever appears on these videos. In some cases, we won't necessarily tackle whether the media is right or wrong, but we'll give context to have a clearer picture of the content of the video. The primary focus of this channel is to analyze the way the media covers the news and try to expose their bias if needed. Think Politics isn't partisan, we criticize both Republicans and Democrats, even third-party politicians, if they have been involved in some wrongdoing. We are neither Liberal nor Conservative, we believe in the free market of ideas so our videos will portray many viewpoints, even contradicting ones. Enjoy, and we hope you like our channel and subscribe.	25	News & Politics	PT10M20S	620	2d	hd	false		5	0	0	0	0

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York. She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion. ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL Welcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.
